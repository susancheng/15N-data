Table S3 contains C:N ratios of sub-pools for plants and soils as reported in the literature. 

Notes:
NA stands for "not available" in the literature.
C:N ratios of all plant subpools at Alptal were estimated by assuming 50% of biomass is carbon, and then dividing by the N concentration reported in the literature.
C:N ratios for foliage at Aber were estimated by assuming 50% of biomass is carbon, and then dividing by the N concentration reported in the literature..
